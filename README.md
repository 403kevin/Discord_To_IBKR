# Discord → IBKR Trading Bot

A Python-based bot that listens to trading signals on Discord and executes orders on Interactive Brokers (IBKR) via TWS or Gateway. It supports real-time market data, advanced trailing stops, bracket orders, and logging for auditability and backtesting.

---

## 🧩 Features

- **Signal Parsing**: Scrapes Discord channels (no Discord API) for trading signals using flexible buzzword heuristics (BTO, STC, TRIM, etc.).
- **IBKR Integration**: Places market, bracket, and trailing-stop orders in IBKR via `ib_insync`.
- **Advanced Trailing Stops**:
  - Premium-based trailing stop (adaptive based on high-water mark)
  - Breakeven move locking
  - Hard stop-loss
  - Time-based exit
- **Fallbacks & Stability**:
  - Snapshot and streaming price fetch with fallbacks to midpoint or historical bars off-hours.
  - Native IB trail orders as a fallback.
- **Logging & Reporting**:
  - CSV trade log (`trade_log.csv`) with timestamp, symbol, qty, price, action, reason.
  - Colorized console + file logging via `custom_logger.py`.
- **Modular Design**:
  - `ib_interface.py`: IBKR connection and contract/order helpers.
  - `message_parsers.py`: Heuristic common parser for Discord message formats.
  - `trailing_stop_manager.py`: Centralized stop-management logic.
  - `trade_logger.py`: Simple CSV logger.
